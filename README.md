## Introduction
 I’ve switched my major in my sophomore year from Mechanical Engineer to Computer Science. It was not easy for me but I’ve been trying. I’ve taken Data Structure and Algorithm, Language Processing, and also the Intro to Web Development online course last semester. I did create a simple website about a fashion store. 

 I still have a lot of things to learn. During this semester, we will create the fitness tracker app, which I really like because this is a real-world project. Therefore, I can build up my resume with this. I think I can learn more skills from this class and use them for my future projects. I really want to come to your office hours to get help because my programming skills are not very good. Besides learning on my own, I really want to have directions to keep myself on track.
